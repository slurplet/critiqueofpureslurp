I created this site for myself to experiment with programming and prose; two nearly dichotomous paradigms of written language. Expect to read short editorials on exercise, philosophy, literature, movies, and science. 

I used [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll), [Minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima) and the following tutorial from the [Programming Historian](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/building-static-sites-with-jekyll-github-pages) to "build" this site. 
You can find the files for Critique of Pure Slurp on my GitHub.
