**Scene 1**

MR. MARTIN and MRS. MARTIN sit on two chairs. There are 3 empty chairs nearby.

*A clock strikes 4 times.*

MR. MARTIN: That dinner was simply deee-licious! I guess you could say that a big fish was fried, and that the bacon did, in fact, arrive.

MRS. MARTIN: But one ought to bring home the turkey as well, no? 

MR. MARTIN: Don't be silly, dear. It was not Thanksgiving the last time I checked. It has been quite a pleasant day in the Martin household, shallowly within the suburbs of Markham. Wouldn't you say so, dear?

MRS. MARTIN: I certainly agree, dear. But has it been a pleasant day in the Martian household? 

MR. MARTIN: Perhaps it has, but I doubt it would be pleasant to be a Martian in a Martin household. 

MRS. MARTIN: My dear husband, I had not thought of that! It most possibly would not be pleasant to be a Martian in a Martin household, much less a Martin in a Martian household. It would be rather marring to be a Martin Martian. 

MR. MARTIN: And a Martian Martin, of course, of course. But, if given the chance, I presume that I would marry a Martin if Martin was a Martian. 

*A clock strikes 3 times.*

MRS. MARTIN: Dear, are you calling me a Martian that you chose to marry? 

MR. MARTIN: Hush, dear, lest we fall into a circle of meanness. 

We hear a knock on the classroom door. 

MR. MARTIN: Oh, I believe there might be someone at the door. 

MRS. MARTIN: But who could it possibly be at this hour? I suppose I will go and investigate.

*MRS. MARTIN goes and opens the door. MR. SMITH and MRS. SMITH walk in, ignoring her. MRS. MARTIN goes and sits down, moving the chairs to face each other. MRS. MARTIN and MR. MARTIN now sit in silence. MR. SMITH and MRS. SMITH stand in the entrance of the classroom.* 

MR. SMITH: Dear Mrs. Smith, my dear, have you seen Mr. Martin and Mrs. Martin anywhere? 

MRS. SMITH: Dear Mr. Smith, my dear, I have not. We should continue our search. 

*They walk around to a new point in the classroom.*

MR. SMITH: Dear Mrs. Smith, my dear, have you seen Mr. Martin and Mrs. Martin anywhere? 

MRS. SMITH: Dear Mr. Smith, my dear, I have not. We should continue our search. 

*They walk around to a new point in the classroom.* 

MR. SMITH: Dear Mrs. Smith, my dear, have you seen Mr. Martin and Mrs. Martin anywhere? 

MRS. SMITH: Dear Mr. Smith, my dear, I have not. We should continue our search. 

MR. SMITH: Perhaps we should ask those two people over there. Maybe they can aid us in our search. 

*The SMITHS walk around to the MARTINS, and sit down in two empty chairs.*

MR. SMITH: Good evening good sir and good evening, good madam. I am Mr. Smith. I am incredibly perplexed as of now. If I were not upset, I would be incredibly content as of now. 

MRS. SMITH: Sometimes bad things lead to good things, and sometimes they do not, my dear. Let us ask this good sir and good madam if they can help us. Good afternoon, good sir and good morning, good madam. Do you, by any chance, know a Mr. and Mrs. Martin? 

MR. MARTIN: My name is Mr. Martin. 

MRS. MARTIN: And my name is Mrs. Martin. Do the Mr. and Mrs. Martin that you know also have the same name? 

MR. SMITH: Potentially. Probably, in fact, I do believe they do. 

MR. MARTIN: Well, what address do these Martins have? 

MRS. SMITH: The Martin household resembles a classroom, within Markham, Ontario, Canada, North America, Earth. 

MRS. MARTIN: Remarkable! I think that could be us. 

MRS. SMITH: Oh hello Mr. and Mrs. Martin! You are a sight that my eyes are able to see, if they are open. 

MRS. MARTIN: I am so content right now that I could be smiling. Mrs. Smith, you don't look a day over Monday. Ha Ha. 

MR. MARTIN: Now now dear, calm down. We don't want our guests to think we are sillier than the bottom of a sunken ship. 

*We hear a knock on the classroom door.* 

MR. SMITH: Oh, I believe there might be someone at the door. 

MRS. SMITH: But who could it possibly be at this hour? I suppose I will go and investigate.

*MRS. SMITH goes and opens the door. POLICEMAN walks in, ignoring her. He sits down in a chair.*

POLICEMAN: Hello, I am the police man. I have an important question for all of you. 

MR. MARTIN: Do continue, Mr. Man, Police man. 

POLICEMAN: Is there any crime in this house? I am a policeman so it is my job to investigate crimes that might happen and have already happened and are currently happening at any time and place. 

MRS. MARTIN: Oh dear! I certainly hope there is no crime in this house! Policeman, find it and stop it right away!

*A clock strikes 5 times.* 

POLICEMAN: Silly me, how could I forget about the time? How do you count to five? I'm not sure how many strikes that was. 

MR. SMITH: Un, deux, trois, quatre, cinq
MRS. SMITH: Une, dix, dix-un, cent, cent-un. 

*MR. MARTIN and MRS. MARTIN count from 1 to 5 on their hands.*

POLICEMAN: The time is certainly running quite quickly, is it not? I might run late to the next crime that will be committed. 

MRS. MARTIN: Please stay for longer, police man! I would love to hear about your workline and the stories that you got from drawing it. 

POLICEMAN: Of course. I have a story for all of you. By any chance, have you heard of the No-Pants Biker? 

MRS. SMITH: No, I have not.

MR. SMITH: No, I have not. 

MRS. SMITH: Dear, do not copy others.  

MR. MARTIN: No, I have not.

MRS. MARTIN: No, I have not.

MR. MARTIN: Dear, do not copy others. 

POLICEMAN: Very well, I shall tell it to you all. Once on top of a time, there was a forest. In the forest, at night, there was a person on top of his bicycle. He had no pants on. I asked him: "Why did you not know to wear pants when on top of your bicycle?" He said: "Because I wore a shirt."

MRS. MARTIN: Oh, isn't that delightful! What a terrifically titillating tale!

POLICEMAN: I have another tale. This one is called the No-Pants Walker. Once there was a time where there was a walker. He had pants on. 

MR. SMITH: Sir, then why was he called the No-Pants Walker?

POLICEMAN: He was called the No-Pants Walker because he was walking in the No-Pants Forest. 

MR. SMITH: Ah, of course, then it makes perfect sense why he would be called the No-Pants Walker. 

*A clock strikes 2 times.* 

POLICEMAN: Silly me, how could I forget about the time? How do you count to two? I'm not sure how many strikes that was. I am a very busy man and I have plenty of important and pressing affairs to attend to. I must leave when it is 10 o clock. 

MR. MARTIN: There were the same amount of strikes as the sum of one apple and one banana. One apple plus one banana is how many apples? 

MRS. MARTIN: One apple, of course. You have one apple combined with one banana, which means there is still one apple. What a peculiar salad indeed. Dear, you are a rather amusing character, aren't you?

MR. SMITH: I think that he meant to ask how many bananas are in a bunch of bananas. That is the answer. 

MRS. SMITH: That's not quite right either. The apples of Niagara Valley tend to have seeds deeply embedded in their flesh. I think that he meant to ask how many seeds were in an apple. 

POLICEMAN: Well, it's rather obvious, I think. I would argue that an apple has exactly one seed, because it is exactly one apple. 

MR. MARTIN: No policeman, that is not right. One apple came from a tree with at least ten apples, because all apple trees in Niagara Valley have at least ten apples. So that must mean all apples have ten seeds. 

MRS. MARTIN: Dear, I think you got that figure confused with the size of a bunch of bananas. Papua New Guinea has at least ten letters, and that is where bananas were first cultivated. That means that a banana is part of a family with nine other banana buddies in a banana split in a banana boat. 

MR. SMITH: Therefore, One apple plus one banana is equal to ten. At least, that is what my computer might tell me if it could speak. Those computers certainly possess a great deal of intelligence, ha ha! 

POLICEMAN: Well, I think that means I have to go and investigate some more crimes. Farewell to all of you!

MRS. SMITH: Farewell, Mr. Policeman.

MR. SMITH: Farewell, Mr. Policeman.

MR. MARTIN: Farewell, Mr. Policeman.

MRS. MARTIN: Farewell, Mr. Policeman.

MR. MARTIN: Farewell, Mr. Policeman.

*The POLICEMAN gets up and leaves, closing the door. Then, he knocks on the door.*

MR. MARTIN: Oh, I believe there might be someone at the door. 

MRS. MARTIN: But who could it possibly be at this hour? I suppose I will go and investigate.

*MRS. MARTIN goes and opens the door. POLICEMAN walks in, ignoring her. He sits down in a chair.* 

POLICEMAN: Is there any crime going on here? 

MR. MARTIN: No, there is not. 

POLICEMAN: Thank you for helping the law, sir. I must extend a sincere hand to you sir, a rare good man amid a sea of ruffians and ships.

*The POLICEMAN shakes MR. MARTIN's hand before leaving.* 

MR. MARTIN: Well then, what were we previously discussing? 

MRS. MARTIN: Dear, we were discussing whether or not it is preferable to eat chocolate-flavoured poop or poop-flavoured chocolate. 

MR. SMITH: Last night, I was doing the worm in the middle of a dance floor with 200 people. I guess you could say that I am a part of the phylum Annelida, as I too am bilaterally symmetrical and somewhat of an invertebrate. 

MRS. SMITH: When will you become a neuroscientist? Just tell me your secret. How do you perform on 8 hours of sleep? If I go through the sleep deprivation grindset for one year, will I become like you? 

MR. MARTIN: You know, I have always wanted to play soccer since the World Cup ended since I feel like I got good at it since watching it for the first time. 

MRS. MARTIN: I feel like I am running on a treadmill and my dream to surpass you is almost within reach, but it keeps getting faster. Whatever shall I do?

MR. SMITH: Just lose. Just ball. 

MRS. SMITH: Praise the Amazons! Praise the Amazon! Praise Amazon! 

MRS. MARTIN: I explored my past by returning to my old ways and now I understand myself better. 

MRS. SMITH: Do you ever find a scratch and don't know where it came from?

MR. MARTIN: Why is chord pronounced cord and not chored?

MRS. SMITH: Notochord. 

MR. SMITH: Not accord. 

MR. MARTIN: Not Concord grapes. 

MRS. MARTIN: Cordless vacuums cordon accordions. 

MR. MARTIN: A

MRS. MARTIN: B

MR. SMITH: C

*A clock strikes 7 times.* 

MRS. SMITH: Dear, I think we should get going. 

MR. SMITH: Very well dear, I think this conversation can be continued when we come back tomorrow. 

MRS. MARTIN: Farewell!

MR. MARTIN: Farewell!

MRS. MARTIN: Au revoir!

MR. MARTIN: Au revoir!

*MR. and MRS. MARTIN get up and walk out of the classroom.* 

*A clock strikes however many times it likes.* 

MR. SMITH: That dinner was simply deee-licious! I guess you could say that a big fish was fried, and that the bacon did, in fact, arrive.

MRS. SMITH: But one ought to bring home the turkey as well, no?
