*Graduation was alright.*

I walked across the stage hungry and sweating, being careful not to trip over my goofy outfit while I collected an empty rolled-up sheet of paper tied with a blue ribbon. How symbolic was it that four years of work was celebrated with a sheet of nothing made to appear as though it was something! If I were writing a literary analysis, I would remark on the evident *amour-propre*, embellishing our hollowest achievements akin to decorating a Linkedin profile of a trash can while searching for a job. The seating, rigorous and alphabetical, was designed in such a way that I could not celebrate with my friends until after the formalities, and it was perhaps reflective of an educational system. The platitudes uttered by administrators I had never encountered before were utterly soulless compared to the passion and nuance delivered by students and teachers; I wonder why?

I couldn’t help but feel a sense of “That was it? I’m just done?” while walking back home on a dimly-lit street. The conversations were fun, the pictures were alright, and there was a sense, a barely-measurable sense of accomplishment I felt basking in a momentary glory. Yet, I didn’t feel any strong emotion. I simply shrugged under the weight of the past and future and went to go live in the present with my fellow graduates.
